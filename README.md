#Western project
#Goal of the project:
The task states the we need to have a 25x25 sized map.
There are 6 field types:
Ground - Green, it is a regular field with no special trait.
Gold - Yellow, the sheriff needs to collect all of them on the map. If he manages to collect them he needs to find the townhall to return the stolen gold. Bandits also can pick it up.
Whiskey - Dark yellow, heals the sheriffs health by 50. Overheal is not possible, so if the sheriff picks it up at a health level where it would raise his hp over 100, it caps and wont excede 100.
Rock - Grey, barrier nor the sherrif nor the badits are able to step on those field.
Sheriff 
Bandit
